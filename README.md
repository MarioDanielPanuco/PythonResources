# PythonResources

* https://pythontutor.com/ - This is something my friend showed me. It was made by a CS professor at Berkeley. It's good to quickly test something in python or to visualize your program (usually recursion or data structures are the most important to visualize, but you won't be doing data structures in your class. 
* https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ - The best python IDE imo
* https://www.anaconda.com/ - This a development environment organizer. Pycharm makes their own enviroment everytime you make a project. This means redownloading libraries. A lot of non-CS STEM people use anaconda to manage their libraries, like a math library or statistics library.
