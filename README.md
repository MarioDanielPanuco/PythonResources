# PythonResources

* https://pythontutor.com/ - This is something my friend showed me. It was made by a CS professor at Berkeley. It's good to quickly test something in python or to visualize your program (usually recursion or data structures are the hardest things to visualize when you first learn them. You don't have to worry about data structures, you won't be learning data structures in your class.

* https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ - The best python IDE imo (I'm pretty sure this has a visualizer extention based on the python tutor site)
* https://www.anaconda.com/ - This a development environment organizer. Pycharm makes their own enviroment everytime you make a project. This means redownloading libraries. A lot of non-CS STEM people use anaconda to manage their libraries, like a math library or statistics library. 
* https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html - This is the official documentation/source code for the default Python libraries that come when you initially install it. If you are going to learn new libraries look up the documentation those libraries. Some people learn programming by working on their side projects and just reading the documenation for libraries they think will help them develop their project.
